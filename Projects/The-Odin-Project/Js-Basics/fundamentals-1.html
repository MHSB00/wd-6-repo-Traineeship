//Name the three ways to declare a variable?
//var, let, const

//Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
//var has no block scope, either function scope or global scope

//What rules should you follow when naming variables?
//name must contain only letters, digits or the symbol & and _

//What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and strings?
//usually sums up numbers but can merge strings together string + number = stringnumber ('1' + 2) = 12

// How does the % operator work?
//remainder, so 10 % 3 = 1 (3*3=9, 10-9=1)

// Explain the difference between == and ===.
//== equals to, === equal value AND equal type


// When would you receive a NaN result?
//Not A Number, its a number thats not a legal number
//1) Number cannot be parsed
//2) Math operation where the result is not a real number (Math.sqrt(-1))
//3) Operand of an argument is NaN
//4) Indeterminate form (0 * infinity or undefined + undefined)
//5) any operation that involves a string is not an addition operation ("foo" / 3)


// How do you increment and decrement a number?
// ++ -- (counter++)

// Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement operators.
// prefix: ++counter shows number post increment. postfix: counter++ show number pre increment

// What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
// the order in how the operators are executed

// How do you access developer tools and the console?
// f12

// How do you log information to the console?
// console.log()


// What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?
// The unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator + applied to a single value, doesnâ€™t do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.
// let apples = "2";
// let oranges = "3";

// alert( apples + oranges ); // "23", the binary plus concatenates strings
// let apples = "2";
// let oranges = "3";

// // both values converted to numbers before the binary plus
// alert( +apples + +oranges ); // 5
