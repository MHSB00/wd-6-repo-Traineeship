// Why is it important to write clean code?
// readability and re-readability

// Name 5 clean code principles previously mentioned
//Revise logic before coding, clearly expose the structure of the page, use correct indentation, write explanatory comments, avoid abusing comments

// What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?
// bad comments
// Writing explanatory notes to self (e.g. /* Will finish this later… */).
// Blaming stuff on other people (e.g. /* John coded this. Ask him. */).
// Writing vague statements (e.g. /* This is another math function. */).
// Erasing chunks of code. Sometimes people are not sure of erasing things and it’s not absolutely evil to comment that code instead.

//good comments
// Authoring specifications (e.g. /* Coded by John, November 13th 2010 */).
// Detailed statements on the functionality of a method or procedure (e.g. /* This function validates the login form with the aid of the e-mail check function */).
// Quick notifications or labels that state where a recent change was made (e.g. /* Added e-mail validation procedure */).
